(R&M) ENTERED THE WEST YARD SECTION OF THE PHILADELPHIA REFINERY AND DISCOVERED A RELEASE OF HEAVY OIL AROUND A VALVE MANIFOLD WHICH CONNECTS THE FM-1 PIPELINE TO THE N-8 PIPELINE.  THE CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE NOTIFIED SUNOCO PERSONNEL AND A RESPONSE WAS INITIATED.  THE VACUUM GAS OIL (VGO) TRANSFER WAS SHUTDOWN AT 14:00 HOURS AND, DUE TO THE HIGH VISCOSITY OF THE PRODUCT, THE HEAVY MATERIAL WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPLACED FROM THE PIPELINE WITH LIGHT CYCLE OIL (LCO) AND ISOLATED BY 18:00 HOURS.    ON 4/5/2010, THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE BEEN A FLANGED CONNECTION ON THE FM-1 PIG TRAP, NORMALLY ISOLATED, EXCEPT DURING PIGGING ACTIVITY.  THE PIG TRAP WAS LAST USED DURING AN IN-LINE INSPECTION CONDUCTED ON JUNE 23, 2008.  A MORE THOROUGH EVALUATION WILL BE PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY THE FAILURE MECHANISM THAT RESULTED IN THE RELEASE FROM THE FLANGED CONNECTION.    A HYDROCHEM (VACUUM TRUCK) EMPLOYEE, WHO ROUTINELY MONITORED AND MANAGED RESIDUAL OIL THAT ACCUMULATED IN REFINERY SUMPS, INCLUDING THE WEST YARD VALVE MANIFOLD VAULT, REPORTED THAT OIL ACCUMULATION APPEARED TO INTENSIFY AND WAS FOUND OUTSIDE THE VAULT BEGINNING ABOUT 3/15/2010.  THIS WAS BELIEVED TO BE CAUSED BY TYPICAL RESIDUAL GROUND SEEPAGE EXACERBATED BY EXCESSIVE RAINFALL AND SNOW THAW.  OPERATIONS TURNOVER REPORTS FROM 3/15/10 TO 3/25/10 HAVE ONLY ONE REPORT OF HEAVY OIL ON WATER (3/18/10).  THIS AGAIN WAS REMOVED BY HYDROCHEM VACUUM TRUCKS.   ON THE MORNING OF 3/16/2010 , TWO SUNOCO EMPLOYEES WERE IN THE WEST YARD FOR TRAINING PURPOSES AND DID NOT NOTICE A LEAK OR HEAVY OIL AT THAT TIME.  ON 3/24/2010 AT 11:00 HOURS, ANOTHER SUNOCO EMPLOYEE WAS IN THE WEST YARD AND DID NOT REPORT A RELEASE AT THAT TIME.    IN ADDITION, ON 3/24 AT 13:37 HOURS, A HYDROCHEM EMPLOYEE ENTERED THE WEST YARD TO VACUUM RESIDUAL OIL FROM THE VALVE MANIFOLD VAULT.  THE RELEASE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE STARTED IN THE 24 HOURS PRIOR TO DISCOVERY.    A TOTAL OF 1,700 BARRELS WAS RELEASED AND NEARLY ALL OF THE MATERIAL HAS BEEN RECOVERED.    5/19/2010 UPDATE:  THE FM-1 PIG TRAP WAS ABOUT 39 1/2' IN LENGTH, MEASURED FROM THE FLANGE AT THE INLET/OUTLET VALVE TO THE FLANGE AT THE CLOSURE.  THE TRAP WAS INITIALLY SUPPORTED AT THREE LOCATIONS.  THE TRAP WAS SUPPORTED AT THE CONTAINMENT WALL AROUND THE MANIFOLD, 9'-4' FROM THE FLANGE AT THE CLOSURE.  THE TRAP WAS ALSO SUPPORTED BY ITS FLANGED CONNECTION TO THE INLET/OUTLET VALVE.  DUE TO ITS LENGTH, IT WAS ALSO SUPPORTED, ADJACENT TO THE FAILED CENTER FLANGE.  THE CENTER FLANGE WAS 5'-0' FROM THE INLET/OUTLET VALVE.  THE CENTER SUPPORT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN LOCATED IN THE 5' SPOOL, WITHIN 12' FROM THE CENTER FLANGE.  THE SUPPORT CONSISTED OF A STRUCTURAL COLUMN, A BASE PLATE AT THE BOTTOM THAT RESTED ON THE FLOOR OF THE MANIFOLD CONTAINMENT, AND A TWO-PART CLAMP-STYLE FITTING AT THE TOP WHICH SECURED THE SUPPORT TO THE OUTSIDE DIAMETER OF THE CARRIER PIPE.  ONCE THE FM-1 TRAP WAS REMOVED, THE CENTER SUPPORT WAS FOUND IN THE CONTAINMENT, DETACHED AND SEPARATED FROM THE FM-1 TRAP PIPING.    IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE LACK OF SUPPORT AT THE CENTER FLANGE, ALLOWED PIPE MOVEMENT OVER TIME, INCLUDING MOVEMENT CAUSED BY THERMAL CYCLING, WHICH APPLIED A DIFFERENTIAL STRESS ON THE FLANGE BOLTS AND EVENTUALLY CAUSED THE FLANGE TO OPEN AT THE 8:00 O'CLOCK POSITION.  THE FM-1 TRAP INLET/OUTLET VALVE WAS FOUND TO HAVE A MECHANICAL DEFECT WHICH PREVENTED A TIGHT SHUT-OFF, WHICH ALLOWED PRODUCT FROM THE FM-1 PIPELINE TRANSFER TO PASS THROUGH THE VALVE, INTO THE PIG TRAP, CAUSING THE RELEASE FROM THE CENTER FLANGE.

THE VENDOR (WILSON VALVE SPECIALTIES) WAS CONTACTED AGAIN BY INVESTIGATION TEAM MEMBERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY WERE AWARE OF SUCH INCIDENTS ON SIMILAR BLOWDOWN VALVES.  THEY INDICATED ONE SUCH VENTING INCIDENT IN WISCONSIN, AND INDICATED THAT A MODIFICATION HAD BEEN SUBSEQUENTLY MADE TO THE VALVE IN QUESTION TO HOUSE THE PILOT VALVE IN A WEATHER-TIGHT ENCLOSURE IN ORDER TO PROTECT IT FROM WEATHER CONDITIONS.  NEW VALVE ASSEMBLIES, WITH WEATHER ENCLOSURES PROTECTING THE PILOT VALVE AS WELL AS THE CONTROLLER, WERE THEN ORDERED FOR VALVE 613 AND THREE OTHER SIMILAR VALES AT THE STATION.  THESE ASSEMBLIES HAVE BEEN INSTALLED AND ALL VALVES APPEAR TO BE FUNCTIONING AS DESIGNED.    TESTING OF THE REPLACED VALVE 613 ASSEMBLY BY WILSON HAS SINCE REVEALED A SMALL SEAL LEAK ON THE BIFFI 745 PILOT CONTROL VALVE, AS WELL AS PLUGGED VENTS, WHICH LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE VENTING INCIDENTS.",GT (Gas Transmission),mscf,34597.47,2012-08-28,8,Gas,"Manchester, MI",2012-08-01

THE CONTROLLER IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED AND SHUT DOWN THE LINE. THE RELEASE WAS LOCATED BY A PIPELINER AT 02:55 AM CST IN PALOS HEIGHTS, COOK COUNTY, IL. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES WERE INITIATED AND ALL LOCAL AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WERE CONTACTED. EXCAVATION REVEALED A SPLIT NEAR A SEAM (ERW) ON THE PIPE. ON AUGUST 31, THE OLD SECTION OF PIPE WAS REMOVED AND A NEW SECTION WAS INSTALLED.    PRESSURE HOLD TESTS WERE SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCTED ON SEPTEMBER 14 AND 15. THE LINE WAS RESTARTED ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2012. AFTER THE REFILL WAS COMPLETED, THE OUTAGE WAS DETERMINED TO BE 704 BARRELS OF JET FUEL. REMEDIATION EFFORTS ARE ONGOING. THE AFFECTED PORTION OF THE PIPE HAS BEEN SENT TO AN INDEPENDENT COMPANY FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS.    APPROXIMATELY 9 BARRELS OF JET FUEL REACHED THE NEARBY CALUMET SAG CHANNEL ON AUGUST 27, 2012. THE CHANNEL WAS CLOSED AND THE BARRELS WERE RECOVERED. THE CHANNEL WAS REOPENED ON AUGUST 28, 2012.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT:  *BBLS RECOVERED UPDATED TO 685.  *PART E UPDATED TO SHOW THAT A CONTROL ROOM ISSUE MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE RELEASE.  *INDEPENDENT METALLURGICAL TESTING AND ANALYSIS ON THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPE HAS BEEN COMPLETED. THE TESTING AND ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE RUPTURE OCCURRED ALONG THE LONG SEAM WELD IN AN AREA WITH REDUCED WALL THICKNESS DUE TO EXTERNAL CORROSION. THE AREAS OF EXTERNAL CORROSION ON THE PIPE CORRESPONDED TO AREAS OF COATING DISBONDMENT ALONG THE 9:00 ORIENTATION AND 3:00 ORIENTATION OF THE 16 DEGREE BEND IN THE PIPE AT THE FAILURE LOCATION. THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF PREFERENTIAL CORROSION AT THE LONG SEAM WELD (GROOVING CORROSION) AT THE ORIGIN OF THE FAILURE. HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH CORROSION ALSO WERE FOUND ON THE SURFACE OF THE PIPE NEAR THE FAILURE, SUGGESTING THAT THEY MAY HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN THE FAILURE.

PRE & POST INCIDENT NON-DESTRUCTIVE EXAMINATION VERIFIED WALL THICKNESS MEASUREMENTS OF THE PIPE WERE WITHIN THE APPROVED PARAMETERS.  PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS USING A MICROMETER OF THE PIPE WERE CONDUCTED AFTER SECTIONING ALSO CONFIRMED THE WALL THICKNESS WAS ACCEPTABLE.  BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH THE WELDING INSPECTOR AND WELDERS AS WELL AS REVIEWING THE DATA SUBMITTED BY THE WELDING INSPECTOR, THE WELDERS WERE NOT BEING FULLY MONITORED DURING THE WELDING OPERATION. IT HAS ALSO BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE WELDERS WERE WELDING OUTSIDE OF THE SPECIFIED PARAMETER RANGES.  SEVERAL MACRO-SECTIONS WERE TAKEN AND PHOTOGRAPHED FROM AREAS BOTH OUTSIDE AND OF CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE BURN-THROUGH LOCATION.  THE PHOTOGRAPHS INDICATE THAT PREVIOUS PASSES FROM THE RESPONSIBLE WELDER WERE WELDED WITHIN ACCEPTABLE WELDING PARAMETERS.  AS THE MACRO-SECTIONS MOVED CLOSER TO THE BURN-THROUGH LOCATION IT CAN BE NOTED THAT THE OVERALL ENERGY INPUTTED INTO THE PIPE REGION INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED TO PREVIOUS PASSES.

METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS INDICATES THE LEAK PATH INVOLVED A 2 3/8 INCH LONGITUDINAL CRACK IN THE SHOULDER OF THE DENT AT THE 5:30 CIRCUMFERENTIAL POSITION AND AN 83/4-INCH LONG CRACK IN THE SLEEVE LONGITUDINAL WELD AT THE 3:00 CIRCUMFERENTIAL POSITION.    THE LONGITUDINAL EDGES OF THE BOTH SLEEVE PIECES WERE SOMEWHAT FLAT RATHER THAN FULLY CONTOURED TO THE OUTSIDE DIAMETER OF THE LINEPIPE. THIS CREATED PEAKING CONDITIONS AT BOTH LONGITUDINAL WELD SEAMS IN THE SLEEVE. THE LONGITUDINAL SEAM WELD AT 3:00 THAT LEAKED ALSO EXHIBITED A WIDE ROOT GAP AND THE BACKING STRIP BENEATH THE SLEEVE DID NOT EXTEND FULLY ACROSS THE GAP. THE RESULT OF THE FIT-UP WAS A WELD WITH INCOMPLETE PENETRATION AND NON-FUSION ALONG THE EDGES OF THE ROOT, PARTICULARLY ALONG THE EDGE THAT LACKED BACKING.     THE MOST LIKELY SEQUENCE OF EVENTS IS THAT THE DENT LEAKED FIRST.

AFTER CLOSING THE UPSTREAM BLOCK VALVE ON LINE 1 (AMITE RIVER) AND SECURING THE SITE, A WORK PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO START INVESTIGATIVE EXCAVATIONS THE FOLLOWING MORNING (LOW LIGHT, FATIGUE, AIR MONITORING DATA PRESENTED UNSAFE CONDITIONS). EXCAVATION BEGAN AT APPROXIMATELY 09:00 ON 1/13/16 AND THE LEAK SOURCE WAS DISCOVERED AT APPROXIMATELY 10:57.  A SMALL CRACK WAS PRESENT IN THE PIPE WALL WITHIN A DENT ON THE BOTTOM SIDE OF THE PIPE (04:59), WHICH WAS APPARENTLY CAUSED BY A LARGE PINE KNOT IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE PIPE AT THE DENT/CRACK LOCATION. SEVERAL OTHER SMALL CRACKS WERE ALSO VISIBLE NEAR THE CRACK WHERE THE LEAK WAS OCCURRING.  A CATCH PAN WAS PLACED BENEATH THE CRACK TO CAPTURE AND RECOVER LEAKING PRODUCT VIA VACUUM TRUCK FROM THE PAN. REPAIR WAS BY A TYPE B SLEEVE, AND SUCCESSFUL NDT TESTING WAS COMPLETED AT APPROXIMATELY 8:06 ON 1/14/16. THE LINE SEGMENT WAS REFILLED AND LINE 1 WAS RESTARTED AT 9:10.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND REMEDIATION HAVE CONTINUED SINCE DISCOVERY OF THE RELEASE. EXCAVATION TO REMOVE CONTAMINATED SOILS AND INSTALLATION OF GROUNDWATER MONITORING WELLS OCCURRED BETWEEN MAY 31-OCTOBER 5, 2016, AT VARIOUS DISTANCES FROM THE RELEASE LOCATION. BASED ON ANALYSIS FROM SOIL AND GROUNDWATER DATA COLLECTED, COLONIAL ESTIMATED A RELEASE VOLUME OF 2,853.5 BARRELS (119,847 GALLONS) ON OCTOBER 24, 2016. APPROXIMATELY 2,313 BARRELS (97,150 GALLONS) OF THIS VOLUME WAS DISCOVERED TO HAVE REACHED THE GROUNDWATER.

SUBSEQUENTLY, MATERIAL EXITED A 3 INCH BLOWDOWN STACK TO ATMOSPHERE BEGINNING ON AUGUST 12TH, 2017 AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 ET.  THE PRESSURE IN THE CS UNIT'S PIPING SLOWLY DECREASED FROM 770 PSIG UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 22:00 EST ON AUGUST 12TH, 2017.  AT THIS TIME, THE PRESSURE STABILIZED AT 560 PSIG UNTIL THE LEAK WAS ISOLATED.  AT APPROXIMATELY 09:00 EST ON AUGUST 13TH, 2017, A PASSERBY REPORTED TO TRANSCANADA THAT IT APPEARED THAT MATERIAL WAS VENTING THROUGH A BLOW-OFF VALVE AT FLAT TOP CS. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS WAS REPORTED, OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO INVESTIGATE THE SITUATION. ON AUGUST 13TH, 2017, OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON-SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 09:40 EST, THE UNINTENDED RELEASE OF MATERIAL WAS IDENTIFIED AND ISOLATED AT APPROXIMATELY 10:15 EST. ONCE OPERATIONS PERSONNEL HAD ISOLATED THE LEAK AND MADE THE AREA SAFE, GAS CONTROL WAS NOTIFIED AND IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED TRANSCANADA'S ON-CALL SPECIALIST AT 11:05 AM ON AUGUST 13TH.  AFTER TRANSCANADA'S ON-CALL SPECIALIST HAD BEEN NOTIFIED, AND GAS LOSS CALCULATIONS WERE DETERMINED TO BE GREATER THAN 3,000 MCF, THE EVENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER.  BEFORE RETURNING THE UNIT BACK TO SERVICE, THE FAULTY VALVE WAS MANUALLY CYCLED FROM THE STATION PANEL AND FULL CLOSURE WAS ACHIEVED. THE OPERATOR THEN CYCLED THE VALVE ONCE MORE TO ENSURE PROPER FUNCTIONALITY. NO ISSUES WERE DISCOVERED ON THE FOLLOW UP INVESTIGATION.       A RCA DISCOVERED A REPLACED VALVE ACTUATOR DID NOT HAVE THE REQUIRED TORQUE TO CLOSE A A 20"" BALL VALVE. A NEW ACTUATOR WILL BE INSTALLED IN 2018.

THE FACILITY IS APPROXIMATELY 1.4 MILES SOUTH OF AVINGER, TEXAS. LINE AM-199 HAS A MAOP OF 1000 PSIG AND IS A SOURCE FOR LINE AM-47, WHICH HAS A MAOP OF 500 PSIG    UPON ARRIVAL AT THE STATION ON THE 10/24/2017, THE O&M TECHNICIAN STOPPED THE VENTING AND INSPECTED THE STATION. HE DISCOVERED THE CONTROLLER WAS FOUND TO HAVE A SET POINT OF 500 PSIG. THE O&M TECHNICIAN MOVED THE CONTROLLER BACK TO THE REQUIRED SET POINT (470 PSIG) AND TIGHTENED THE CONTROLLER ARM, WHICH WAS LOOSE. AFTER THE COMPLETION OF ALL WORK, A TEST GAGE WAS INSTALLED AND THE PRESSURE WAS MONITORED. THE STATION OPERATED NORMALLY AT THE 470 PSIG SET POINT FOR 30 MINUTES.    THE NRC WAS NOTIFIED ON 10/24/2017 AT 11:45 (NRC# 1194155). A FOLLOW UP CALL WAS PROVIDED TO THE NRC ON 10/26/2017 AT 09:00 (NRC# 1194335).     WHILE THIS LOCATION DOES NOT HAVE MEASUREMENT FACILITIES, THERE IS A MEASUREMENT STATION 20 MILES UPSTREAM AND ANOTHER 12 MILES DOWNSTREAM.

AN OUTAGE PREVENTION FORM WAS UTILIZED AND TEST GAUGE WAS INSTALLED TO MONITOR PRESSURE AT THE STATION WHILE TESTING. AT THE TIME OF THEIR ARRIVAL, THE CONTROLLER NEEDLE INDICATED A SET POINT OF APPROXIMATELY 420 PSIG. ALTHOUGH THE TEST GAUGE READ A PRESSURE OF 470 PSIG, THE SET POINT ON THE CONTROLLER WAS WITHIN THE REQUIRED RANGE AND NO ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE.

THE INSTANTANEOUS NATURE OF OVERLOAD FAILURE AND THE TIME DURATION FROM WHEN THE PIPE WAS INSTALLED UNTIL THE FAILURE OCCURRED SUGGESTS LOADING CONDITIONS CHANGED OVER TIME; HOWEVER, THE EXACT CAUSE FOR THIS FAILURE COULD NOT BE DETERMINE FROM METALLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS.  CORROSION WAS NOT FOUND TO BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN THE FAILURE.    THE RCA TEAM SIMILARLY DETERMINED THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PIPELINE FAILURE TO BE OVERLOAD AS A RESULT OF APPROXIMATELY 21' OF FILL MATERIAL ON TOP OF THE GAS PIPELINE WHICH LACKED SUPPORT DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF HIGHLY COMPRESSIBLE SOILS BELOW THE PIPELINE.  THE WELD ID OFFSET (HI-LO) WHICH EXCEEDED CODE ALLOWABLE 0.155"" VERSUS 3/32"" (.09375) AT THE 2009 REMEDIATION TIE-IN TO EXISTING PIPE WAS DETERMINE TO BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR BUT NOT A SECONDARY ROOT CAUSE.

(CPL) CONTROL CENTER. FOUR MINUTES LATER, AT 23:17, SHUTDOWN OF THE EL RENO TO CUSHING SYSTEM #1 SEGMENT WAS INITIATED. AT 23:47, ALL VALVES WERE CLOSED ON THE SEGMENT EXCEPT FOR VALVE 0912, WHICH WAS LEFT OPEN TO ALLOW FOR DRAIN DOWN TO THE TANKS AT CPL'S CUSHING STATION NEAR CUSHING, OKLAHOMA. ON FEBRUARY 18, 2018, AT 02:50, THE LEAK WAS LOCATED AT MP 67.99 IN OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, BY A CPL EMPLOYEE. THE LEAK WAS THEN REPORTED TO CPL'S CONTROL CENTER AT 02:55. THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) WAS NOTIFIED OF THE LEAK AT 03:36 ON FEBRUARY 18, 2018. THE FAILED PIPE IS LOCATED UNDER A POND AT MP 67.99; APPROXIMATELY 3,376 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WAS RECOVERED OF THE 3,381 BARRELS RELEASED. NO PRODUCT WAS LEFT IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY.

DUE TO THE DELAYED NATURE OF THE FAILURE, CPL SELECTED ""PREVIOUS DAMAGE DUE TO EXCAVATION ACTIVITY"" AS THE EXCAVATION DAMAGE - SUB-CAUSE IN QUESTION G3; HOWEVER, STRONG CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AND THE CONCLUSION OF THE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INDICATE A HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT THE DAMAGE WAS CAUSED IN NOVEMBER 2016 BY AN EXCAVATION CONTRACTOR ADDRESSING A PIPE FLAW FOUND DURING PIPE INSPECTION ACTIVITIES. THE DAMAGE DID NOT MANIFEST IMMEDIATELY SINCE THE INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THE MECHANICAL DAMAGE CAUSED HEATING TO THE PARENT METAL DUE TO FRICTION AND CHANGED THE METALLIC STRUCTURE OF THE STEEL, WHICH RESULTED IN CRACK GROWTH UNTIL THE CRACK BECAME CRITICAL AND FAILED.    2. THE VOLUME OF PRODUCT RECOVERED IN QUESTION A11 IS UPDATED TO REFLECT THAT, SINCE THE PRIOR SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT, ALL OIL HAS BEEN RECOVERED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH FURTHER REMEDIATION EFFORTS. THESE FINAL FIVE BARRELS OF PRODUCT RECOVERED ARE REFLECTED IN THIS SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT.    3.

BLM UTILIZED A CONTRACTOR TO REPLACE BOTH THE INBOARD AND OUTBOARD SEALS ON THE ETHYLENE PUMP.  ONCE THE SEALS WERE REPLACED, OPERATIONS PERSONNEL COMMISSIONED THE EQUIPMENT.  BLM AND CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL WERE PRESENT WHEN PUMP WAS RESTARTED. TERMINAL CONSOLE SUPPLIED START COMMEND TO PUMP. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PUMP WAS STARTED, SEAL ALARMS BECAME PRESENT ON THE CONSOLE. OPERATIONS TECH CALLED CONTROL ROOM TO SHUT OWN THE PUMP BECAUSE IT HAD CAUGHT ON FIRE. THE PUMP EXPERIENCED AN ESD DUE TO VIBRATIONS BEFORE THE CONSOLE COULD SHUT IT DOWN.    OPERATIONS BEGAN ISOLATING THE WHOLE PUMP HEADER AND BEGAN SENDING ETHYLENE TO FLARE ON THE PROCESS PIPING. OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ALSO POINTED THE FRESHWATER FIRE MONITORS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PUMP. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS NOTIFIED AND THEY EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE. THE FAILURE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE FIRE WAS CAUSED BY ETHYLENE BEING RELEASED AND IGNITED DUE TO IMPROPER INSTALLATION OF THE DRIVE-END MECHANICAL SEAL BY THE CONTRACTOR.    12-10-19 UPDATED TO CORRECT RESPONSE TO PART D QUESTION 3 (NO LONG TERM IMPACT ASSESSMENT WAS PERFORMED OR IS PLANNED).

THE INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE RELIEF VALVE'S DESIGNED SET POINT IS 1050 PSIG HOWEVER, THE INVESTIGATION ALSO FOUND THAT THE RELIEF VALVE WAS LAST SET AT 970 PSIG. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE CAUSE FOR THE RELIEF VALVE DRIFT WAS DUE TO VIBRATION AND PRESSURE PULSATIONS FROM THE UNIT. ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE AMOUNT OF UNINTENTIONAL RELEASED GAS WAS THAT THE RELIEF VALVE'S VENT LINE CONNECTING PIPE NIPPLE FOR THE PRESSURE SWITCH WAS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN BROKEN AT THE CONNECTING THREADS TO THE PRESSURE SWITCH.

HE NOTICED A GAS RELEASE SOUND UPON EXITING HIS VEHICLE NEAR THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING. THE TECH REPORTED THE ISSUE TO THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR AND WAS INSTRUCTED TO TRY TO IDENTIFY THE LEAK. HE IDENTIFIED IT WAS COMING FROM THE BLOWDOWN SILENCER AS THE TECH COULD VISUALLY SEE THE GAS VENTING AND ALSO OBSERVED FROSTING ON THE SILENCER. THE TECH THEN PROCEEDED TO THE CONTROL ROOM AND ULTIMATELY IDENTIFIED THAT THE NORMALLY CLOSED REMOTED OPERATED 4IN COMPRESSOR LOADING VALVE WAS OPEN ON THE UNIT #2 LOAD LINE ALLOWING GAS TO VENT THROUGH THE NORMALLY OPEN COMPRESSOR VENT VALVE. THE TECH PROCEEDED TO CLOSE THE MANUAL BLOCK VALVE ON THE LOAD LINE ASSEMBLY AT 1:36PM TO STOP THE LEAK. THE LEAK STOPPAGE WAS REPORTED TO KM MANAGEMENT AT 1:40PM. AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, IT WAS UNKNOWN THE QUANTITY OF GAS RELEASED BUT ON THE 2:35PM ERL CALL IT WAS DETERMINED TO REPORT TO THE NRC AS A PRECAUTION. IT WAS REPORTED TO THE NRC AT 2:46PM LOCAL TIME WITH THE UNKNOWN AMOUNT. THE REPORT NUMBER WAS 1264245.    48 HOUR UPDATE:  DURING INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE GAS HAD BEEN VENTING THROUGH THE BLOWDOWN SILENCER FOR ABOUT 6 DAYS. THIS WAS REPORTED TO THE NRC (#1264366) ON THE 48 HR UPDATE AT 4:54PM LOCAL TIME ON 11/19/19.    INVESTIGATION:  DURING INVESTIGATION, IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE UNIT #2 LOAD LINE VALVE OPENED ON 11/12/19 AT 11:43PM. THE LOAD LINE VALVE OPENED AS A RESULT OF FREEZING UP OF MOISTURE IN THE SOLENOID CONTROL BOX. AT STA 856, THE TEMPERATURE ON 11/12/19 WENT BELOW FREEZING AT 4PM AND WAS APPROXIMATELY 22 °F AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. THIS AREA DOES HAVE WINTERIZATION PROCEDURES AND PLANS IN PLACE AND IS SCHEDULED IN MAXIMO TO BE PERFORMED MONTHLY NOVEMBER THROUGH MARCH. HOWEVER, SINCE THIS OCCURRED MID-MONTH, THE PLAN WAS NOT COMPLETED AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.    THE TIMING OF THE EVENT IS VALIDATED BY THE VALVE EVENT LOGS, THE ALARMS, AND THE PRESSURE RISE IN THE UNIT #2 PIPING AT THAT TIME OF THE EVENT. THE PRESSURE ON THE DISCHARGE OF UNIT #2 WHERE THE VENT VALVE IS LOCATED AVERAGED 135 PSI. THIS BACKPRESSURE FLUCTUATED WITH THE MAINLINE LINE PRESSURE AND WAS CREATED BY THE RESTRICTION OF AN ORIFICE PLATE ON THE INLET TO THE SILENCER. THE ORIFICE PLATE ON THE SILENCER IS A DESIGNED PLATE WITH 4 X 1.25"" HOLES FOR CUTTING THE PRESSURE GOING INTO THE SILENCER. WHEN CALCULATING GAS LOSS IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THE ORIFICE PLATE ACTED AS 4 INDEPENDENT HOLES. THE TOTAL GAS LOSS CALCULATED WAS 116,172 MCF.    THE GAS THAT PRESSURIZED THE UNIT #2 COMPRESSOR CASE ALSO PRESSURIZED THE UNIT #1 CASE. WHEN THE PLC SAW THE CASE PRESSURE ELEVATED ON UNIT #2, IT TRIGGERED THE UNIT TO TRY TO MAINTAIN SEAL OIL PRESSURE TRIGGERING ALARMS AND EVENT STATUSES. OVER THE COURSE OF THE EVENT THERE WERE 3 STATION WARNING CALLOUTS THAT WERE TRIGGERED THROUGH ALARMS ORIGINATING FROM THE LOAD LINE VALVE OPERATING. THESE ALARMS INDICATED ISSUES WITH UNIT 1 AND UNIT 2 IN RELATION TO THE SEAL OIL SYSTEMS. THE TECH RESPONDING TO THE CALLOUTS LOGGED IN REMOTELY TO ASSESS THE SCADA ALARMS. THE TECH VIEWED ONLY THE STATION LEVEL ALARM SCREEN AND UNIT 1A ALARM SCREEN, AND EITHER DIDN'T LOOK AT OR DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EVENTS. THE TECH ALSO DIDN'T LOG INTO THE UNIT 2A LEVEL MACHINES TO VIEW THE UNIT SPECIFIC ALARM SCREEN. IN ADDITION TO THE 2 EVENTS ON THE NIGHT THE INCIDENT ORIGINATED THERE WAS ALSO A CALLOUT 3 DAYS LATER AGAIN AS A RESULT OF A UNIT 2A ALARM THAT WAS NOT FOLLOWED UP ON.    FOLLOW-UP ACTION ITEMS:  OPERATIONS HAS CHANGED THE MAXIMO WORK ORDER TO BEGIN WINTERIZATION PLANS IN OCTOBER INSTEAD OF NOVEMBER.    ALSO, THE TECH WAS PREVIOUSLY TRAINED ON SCADA AND HOW TO MANAGE ALARMS; HOWEVER AFTER THIS INCIDENT, OPERATIONS HELD RE-TRAINING FOCUSING ON ALARM LOG REVIEW AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT RESPONSES.

THE WALL THICKNESS OF THE LINE PIPE IN THE REGION OF THE FACTURE WAS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN REDUCED DUE TO HEAVY O.D. CORROSION AT THE 12 O'CLOCK POSITION (TOP OF LINE). THE WALL IN THIS REGION WAS REDUCED (WALL THICKNESS RANGING FROM 0.013 INCH TO 0.088 INCH MEASURED NEAR RUPTURE) TO THE POINT WHERE IT COULD NO LONGER SUPPORT THE HOOP STRESS GENERATED BY THE INTERNAL LINE PRESSURE (225 PSIG). BY USING THE BARLOW'S FORMULA AND THE TENSILE STRENGTH OBTAINED IN THE MECHANICAL TESTING, IT IS CALCULATED THAT WITH AN INTERNAL PRESSURE OF 225 PSIG AND A TENSILE STRENGTH OF 66,542 PSI, RUPTURE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO OCCUR AT A WALL THICKNESS OF APPROXIMATELY 0.027.    THE ANALYSIS PERFORMED ON THE FAILED SECTION OF LINE N SHOW EXTENSIVE O.D. CORROSION OF THE TOP PORTION OF THE PIPE.

IT IS DETERMINED THAT 70 YEARS OF SEASONAL EXPOSURE TO WATER AND ATMOSPHERE, WITH COATING DETERIORATION  AT THE 12 O'CLOCK POSITION, REDUCED THIS SECTION OF PIPE TO WHERE IT COULD NO LONGER SUPPORT THE HOOP STRESS GENERATED BY THE INTERNAL LINE PRESSURE (225 PSIG).  ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  THE FAILED SECTION OF LINE HAS NEVER BEEN EXPOSED. ALONG WITH ANNUAL PATROLS THERE HAVE BEEN ADDITIONAL EXPOSURE INSPECTIONS ON THIS LINE. A CLOSE INTERVAL SURVEY WAS PERFORMED IN 2016 AND THE CREW DID NOT SEE ANY PIPE EXPOSED AND IN 2018 THE OPS SOUTHERN DIVISION LAUNCHED AN EXPOSED PIPE INITIATIVE. DURING THIS INITIATIVE THE FAILED SECTION WAS NOT SEEN OR DETERMINED TO BE EXPOSED. THERE WAS AN EXPOSURE ROUGHLY 700 FEET TO THE NORTH OF THE FAILURE SITE THAT WAS DISCOVERED IN 2006.

PLEASE REFER TO THAT INCIDENT REPORT FOR THE INITIAL NARRATIVE.      THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT HAS BEEN CHANGED IN PART G FROM EXTERNAL CORROSION TO INTERNAL CORROSION.  THIS CHANGE HAS OCCURRED BECAUSE OF DATA THAT WAS GATHERED FROM RUNNING A HIGH RESOLUTION VERTALOG, WHICH CAN DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CORROSION.  THE INTERNAL CORROSION WAS ALSO VERIFIED WITH A CALIPER LOG THAT WAS RUN DOWN THE CASING WITH THE VERTALOG TOOL.      AS NOTED IN THE INITIAL REPORT, THE WELL WAS KILLED AND THEN A COMPOSITE PLUG WAS PLACED AT 4479' JUST ABOVE THE PERFORATIONS.  A PRODUCTION CASING WAS INSTALLED FROM SURFACE TO 4431'.  THE PRODUCTION CASING WAS CEMENTED IN PLACE.  CEMENT WAS RUN DOWN THE INSIDE OF THE INNER CASING AND THERE WERE RETURNS TO SURFACE THROUGH THE ANNULAR SPACE BETWEEN THE NEW PRODUCTION CASING AND THE OUTER CASING.  THIS SEALED THE LEAK IN THE OUTER CASING AND PROVIDES A MITIGATION AGAINST ADDITIONAL LEAKS.  A CEMENT BOND LOG WAS RUN FOR THE CEMENTING WORK OF THE INNER CASING AND NO DEFICIENCIES WERE NOTED IN THE LOG.  A PRESSURE TEST WAS COMPLETED ON THE NEW INSTALLATION AND NO ISSUES WERE NOTED DURING THE TEST.  FOLLOWING THE INTEGRITY TESTING, THE COMPOSITE PLUG WAS DRILLED OUT.  THE WELL WAS THEN RE-COMMISSIONED ON 12/01/20.  THE WELL HAS BEEN OPERATING FOR TWO WEEKS WITH NO IDENTIFIED ISSUES.  AS AN ADDITIONAL MITIGATION, LEAK SURVEYS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AROUND THE WELL AND ALONG THE PREVIOUS INCIDENT PLUME BOUNDARY.      THE PLUME FROM THE INCIDENT HAS DISSIPATED SIGNIFICANTLY.

THE DCC CONTACTED THE PIPELINE FOREMAN WHO DISPATCHED THE APPROPRIATE DENBURY PERSONNEL TO THE SITE.  DENBURY PERSONNEL ARRIVED ONSITE AT 21:50 AND MADE THE DETERMINATION THAT A CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) LEAK WAS OCCURRING NEAR THE JUNCTION OF THE LOCKHART LATERAL AND NEJD PIPELINE.  IT WAS INITIALLY UNKNOWN WHETHER THE LEAK WAS ON THE LOCKHART LATERAL OR THE NEJD PIPELINE.  THE LA STATE POLICE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL HOTLINE WAS NOTIFIED AT 22:45 (STATE POLICE REPORT # 20-03507), FOLLOWED BY THE NOTIFICATION TO THE LIVINGSTON PARISH OFFICE OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AT 23:01.  THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) WAS THEN NOTIFIED AT 23:07 (NRC #1286945).  AT 22:21 THE NEJD PIPELINE PUMPS SUPPLYING PRESSURE TO THE AFFECTED AREA WERE SHUT DOWN.  BECAUSE THE AREA OF THE LEAK COULD NOT BE ACCESSED DUE TO LACK OF VISIBILITY CAUSED BY THE CO2 RELEASE, THE INTERCONNECT VALVE COULD NOT BE SAFELY SHUT, IN ORDER TO ISOLATE THE NEJD PIPELINE FROM THE LOCKHART LATERAL.  THEREFORE THE NEJD MAINLINE VALVES THAT ISOLATE THE NEJD SEGMENT, CONTAINING THE LOCKHART INTERCONNECT, WERE CLOSED IN ORDER TO ULTIMATELY LIMIT THE LEAK VOLUME, IN THE EVENT THE LEAK WAS DETERMINED TO BE ON THE NEJD PIPELINE.   THE NEJD MAINLINE VALVES WERE CLOSED AT 23:02 AND 23:23.  AT 23:48 HOURS, EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONTRACTORS ARRIVED ON-SITE AND BEGAN CONDUCTING PRELIMINARY AIR-MONITORING FOR RESPONSE PERSONNEL.

AT 7:15 ON 9/10/2020,  SITE CONDITIONS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SO THAT DENBURY PERSONNEL WERE ABLE TO SAFELY ACCESS THE LOCKHART JUNCTION VALVE LOCATION.  AT THIS TIME THE LOCATION OF THE LEAK WAS IDENTIFIED TO BE ON THE LOCKHART LATERAL, SO THE TAP VALVE AND A DOWNSTREAM, ABOVE GROUND, ISOLATION VALVE WERE IMMEDIATELY CLOSED AT THE FACILITY TO ISOLATE THE LEAK. AT 8:05 NO PRODUCT WAS OBSERVED COMING FROM THE LEAK LOCATION.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK OCCURRED DUE TO AN ISOLATION GASKET FAILURE AT AN ABOVE GROUND FLANGED JOINT ON THE LOCKHART LATERAL .  ON 9/11/2020 THE FAILED ISOLATION GASKET WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED.  REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED AT 10:00 AND THE PIPELINE SEGMENT WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE.

AT 05:19-HOURS, GAS CONTROL RECEIVED A SCADA ALARM.  THE CONTROLLER ON DUTY, USING THE CALL-OUT SYSTEM, NOTIFIED THE PROPER OPERATIONS PERSONNEL AT THAT TIME.      AT 06:04-HOURS, OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT ELLERSLIE COMPRESSOR STATION AND CONFIRMED NATURAL GAS WAS VENTING.  UPON SAFELY ENTERING THE COMPRESSOR STATION PROPERTY, THE OPERATIONS PERSONNEL BEGAN INSPECTING THE COMPRESSOR STATION TO DETERMINE WHY NATURAL GAS WAS STILL VENTING FOLLOWING THE ESD FUNCTION.  OPERATIONS PERSONNEL FOUND VALVE #19 WHICH IS PART OF THE ESD SYSTEM LOCATED IN THE SUCTION SIDE OF THE STATION PIPING, HAD NOT FULLY CLOSED.  OPERATIONS PERSONNEL MANUALLY CLOSED VALVE #19 AND THE STATION WAS SHUT DOWN AT 6:30-HOURS.  FIELD OPERATIONS INITIATED THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE LINE (ERL) PROCESS FOLLOWING INTERNAL PROCEDURES AND THE INCIDENT WAS DEEMED REPORTABLE DURING THE ERL CALL.     AS PART OF SNG'S POST INCIDENT INVESTIGATION PROCESS THE OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ON SITE DISCOVERED AN EXIT POINT IN THE COMPRESSOR STATION YARD WITH SOME ICE FORMED NEAR AN UNDERGROUND ESD FACILITY PIPE.  SNG STARTED THE EXCAVATION PROCESS TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF THE UNDERGROUND LEAK.  AFTER EXPOSING THE UNDERGROUND ESD PIPE, SNG DISCOVERED THAT THE 1/2-INCH ESD PIPE HAD A CRACK IN A THREADED CONNECTION.     DURING THE ROOT-CAUSE ANALYSIS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CRACKED UNDERGROUND ESD PIPE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE ESD EVENT.  FURTHERMORE, THE ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED THAT VALVE #19 DID NOT FULLY CLOSE AS DESIGNED ALLOWING THE VOLUME OF GAS RELEASED TO BE ABOVE THE PHMSA REPORTABLE THRESHOLD.     OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT EXPEDITED A CONTRACTOR TO COME ON SITE AND REPAIR THE BURIED 1/2-INCH ESD LINE.  THE CRACKED PIPE WAS SENT TO A LAB FOR FURTHER ASSESSMENT AND THE LINE REPAIR WAS COMPLETED ON DECEMBER 26, 2020.      OPERATIONS PERSONNEL CHECKED AND CYCLED VALVE #19 WITH NO ISSUE.  VALVE #19 IS CLOSED AND LOCKED OUT OF SERVICE.  SNG OPERATIONS HAS ORDERED A NEW SHAFER OPERATOR FOR 2021 INSTALLATION.       WITH GENERAL SAFETY INSPECTION OF THE COMPRESSOR STATION AND COORDINATION WITH GAS CONTROL, THE COMPRESSOR STATION RETURNED TO SERVICE AT 22:15-HOURS, DECEMBER 26, 2020.    THE LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE 1/2-INCH ESD LINE PIPE SPECIMEN DETERMINED THE CRACK OCCURRED BECAUSE OF HIGH CYCLE, LOW NOMINAL STRESS BENDING FATIGUE INITIATING IN THE ROOT OF THE THREADS.  THE ANALYSIS ALSO NOTED THE STEEL PIPE CHEMISTRY DID NOT MEET ASTM A53 GRADE B STANDARDS DUE TO HIGHER PHOSPHORUS CONTENT.  HOWEVER, TESTING FOUND THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF THE STEEL MEETS THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF ASTM A53 GRADE B.

COMPANY PERSONNEL REQUESTED THAT THE FIRE COMPANY STAND-BY UNTIL GAS VENTING SUBSIDED AT WHICH POINT THE AREA WOULD BE SECURED. PERSONNEL COMPLETED A SITE EVALUATION AND DETERMINED UNIT 4A HAD GONE OFFLINE. WHEN UNIT 4A WENT OFFLINE THE COMPRESSOR CASE VENT OPENED AS DESIGNED BUT THE UNIT SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES WERE UNABLE TO CLOSE DUE TO THE CPU FAILURE WHICH ALLOWED FOR THE UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS.  THE INTERNAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE LINE (ERL) CALL NOTIFICATION WAS INITIATED PER COMPANY PROCEDURES TO DISCUSS THE INCIDENT. IT WAS DETERMINED ON THE CALL THAT THE QUANTITY OF GAS RELEASED WOULD MEET THE PHMSA-REPORTABLE THRESHOLD AND THE NRC WAS NOTIFIED.  PERSONNEL MANUALLY CLOSED BOTH SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES AT 12:10 PM AND VENTING CEASED. SOLAR WAS CONTACTED AND A SOLAR FIELD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (FSR) ARRIVED ON SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 5 PM TO BEGIN TROUBLESHOOTING UNIT 4A. THE SOLAR FSR WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE UNIT 4A SHUTDOWN WAS A RESULT OF A MAJOR PROCESSOR (CPU) FAILURE CAUSING A UNIT 'FAST STOP'.  A NEW PROCESSOR WAS INSTALLED AND UNIT 4A STARTED NORMALLY AFTER GOING THROUGH ITS AUTOMATIC PRESTART CHECKS.    UNIT 4A WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE ON SUNDAY EVENING, JANUARY 2, 2022, AFTER ADDITIONAL TESTING ENSURED NO OTHER ABNORMAL ISSUES WERE PRESENT.",GT (Gas Transmission),mscf,11116,2022-01-01,1,Gas,"Libertyville, NJ",2022-01-01
